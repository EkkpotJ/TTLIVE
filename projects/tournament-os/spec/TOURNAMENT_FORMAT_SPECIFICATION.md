# Tournament Format Specification

Initial target: Golden Spatula weekly tournament.

The first version should support a group-based format with cumulative points because this matches score-based games better than a complex bracket-first system.

For configurable multi-game support, see `RULE_ENGINE_SPEC.md`. That file defines how tournament models, scoring rules, advancement rules, lobby shuffle, and time/player variables should affect generated tournament structure.

## MVP Format

Name: Golden Weekly

Participant type: Solo player

Default capacity:

- 64 players

Default stage structure:

```text
Round 1
  8 groups
  8 players per group
  Top 4 advance

Round 2

  16 players
```

This format is a starting assumption and must be reviewed before real use.

## Tie-Break Rules

Tie-break rules are not final.

3. Higher latest-round score
4. Lower penalty total
5. Admin decision with audit note

## Bye Rules

Supported bye behaviors:

- Average points from previous completed rounds

MVP recommendation:

- Use fixed bye points only if the tournament rules announce it before registration closes.
- Otherwise use advance-only bye to avoid score disputes.

## Public Result Rules

- Show approved scores by default.
- Mark pending scores as pending if public pending visibility is enabled.
- Never show phone number, Line ID, Discord ID, or private evidence links publicly.
