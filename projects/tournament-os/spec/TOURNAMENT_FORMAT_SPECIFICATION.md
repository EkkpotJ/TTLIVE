# Tournament Format Specification

Initial target: Golden Spatula weekly tournament.

The first version should support a group-based format with cumulative points because this matches score-based games better than a complex bracket-first system.

## MVP Format

Name: Golden Weekly

Participant type: Solo player

Default capacity:

- 64 players

Default stage structure:

```text
Round 1
  8 groups
  8 players per group

This format is a starting assumption and must be reviewed before real use.

MVP recommendation:

- Use fixed bye points only if the tournament rules announce it before registration closes.
- Otherwise use advance-only bye to avoid score disputes.
