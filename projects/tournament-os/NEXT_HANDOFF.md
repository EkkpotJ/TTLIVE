3. Finalize PostgreSQL schema from `spec/ER_DIAGRAM.md` and `spec/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`.
4. Define API request/response schemas.
5. Create FastAPI backend skeleton.
6. Create SQLAlchemy models.
7. Create Alembic migrations.
8. Implement registration service.
9. Implement tournament setup service.
10. Implement rule set validation service.
11. Implement score calculation service.
12. Implement leaderboard service.
13. Implement audit log service.
14. Add tests.
