# Tournament Operating System

Tournament Operating System is the planned web system for running game competitions from registration to final results.

This is a separate subsystem added for tournament cases. It is intentionally isolated from the normal TTLIVE weekly live workflow so it can later become a real application or its own repository.

System boundary: `SYSTEM_BOUNDARY.md`

Next development handoff: `NEXT_HANDOFF.md`

The system should help a solo organizer or small team manage:

- Player or team registration
- Admin approval
- Tournament setup
- Group and bracket generation
- Per-round score entry
- Automatic point totals
- Public leaderboards
- Score verification and disputes
- Exportable results

Current phase: specification.

Do not start full application development until the core rules in `spec/BUSINESS_RULES.md`, `spec/STATE_MACHINE.md`, and `spec/TOURNAMENT_FORMAT_SPECIFICATION.md` are reviewed.
